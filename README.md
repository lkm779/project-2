## General Information

- This is a one week time project developed under the supervision of Alok and the guidance of the Clients brief documentation.
- What problem does it (intend to) solve?
  The main functionalities that the SPA wants to deliver to the user are based on the 4 main deliverables which are always focused from the Client perspective and to a greater extent with a final user approach:
  • Add a new item
  • Edit an item
  • Mark item as watched
  • Remove an item
- What is the purpose of your project?
  The purpose of the project is to build an SPA from scratch, with the help of specific technologies and the data taken from an already setted API, to deliver some specific features to a potential customer and meeting the client´s requirements.

## Technologies Used

- Code sandbox as the main online web development editor for the project.
- React as a base in the development of the UI and component as single-page-application

## Project Status

Project is: _complete_. 

## Challenges:
-Planning: One of the main issues I had from the beginning was the planning in terms of implementing a solid wireframe and user-story to later on implement a high level component design and then from there move to the low level design  apply all the functionalities 
-Restructuring: At the same time this issues contributed of failing to deliver one unique project and that´s one of the reasosn why i had to build several projects from scratch.
-Passing the state: I also had several issues passing the states at different times of the project which difficulted me from delivering unwatch all and remove all deliverables, as these kept crashing the app I had to proceed to delete them.



## Room for Improvement

Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

The main areas to be improved are
